# Job Application Simulator
Job applications are a pain to complete, so why not have it as a game anyway? In this game, your choices matter. One click could lead you to an entirely different ending. You, the player, does the impossible to... get a minimum wage job and live the rest of your life having to take a 3rd mortgage out of your home.

# Compiling
Unlike literally any project you'll find, installing and playing with the source code is just as easy as downloading the files and opening the project in Godot 4.2. That's it. Like.. wow.

# Note from the Developer
My only concern about the game being open source would be the audio and models I took. Yeah I read the licenses, but that was like seven months ago and I can't remember crap. I don't think this license covers that stuff, so yay. My main point is that I don't want to get sued.
